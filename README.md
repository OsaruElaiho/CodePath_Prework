**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Osaru Elaiho**

Time spent: **≈ 4** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://infrequent-striped-hubcap.glitch.me/

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [✅] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [✅] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
* [✅] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
* [✅] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [✅] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
* [✅] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [✅] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [✅] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [✅] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [✅] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [✅] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [✅] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [✅] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [✅] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [-] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [-] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented: N/A

- List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
  - Implement a difficulty setting that allows users to choose the intesity of the game 🎮
    - difficulty factors include clue speed and length, as well as the time length for user guesses on each round
  - Implement a "strike" sound effect to indicate an incorrect guess ❌
  - Implement a "ticking clock" sound effect to imitate a countdown timer 🕐
    - as the clock winds down, gradually increase the time interval of the "ticking"
  - Implement an "alarm" sound effect to indicate alert 🚨

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
- https://fontawesome.com/ --> open source library of icons to implement in apps
- https://www.w3schools.com/ --> website with tutorials and references relating to web development topics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.
- https://www.ece.iastate.edu/~alexs/classes/2016_Spring_575/HW/HW5/files/piano-key-freq-wikipedia.pdf --> chart with piano key frequencies(Hz)

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- A specific challenge I encountered while working on this assignment was coming out of my comfort zone and utilizing languages I was not necessarily acquainted with beforehand. Majority of my knowledge in the domain of computer science pertains to the back-end code using data structures and algorithms, so it was quite exciting to dive into development on the front-end side of code. Before beginning the project, I took it upon myself to read up on the background material provided as well as the tutorial website listed above. This course of action greatly helped my overall understanding and allowed for me to finish the project with all the basic features, including some of the optional ones, with little to no interruption in my thought process. However, I did happen to run into a problem with my first attempt at implementing a random secret pattern and allowing the user to make three mistakes before the game ends. In both these cases, the problem was due to a logic error that I was unable to solve a first glance. Thus, I felt that the best approach for me, seeing as I'm a visual learner, would be to pull out the whiteboard and map out the logic for both those features. Upon doing so, I was able to spot and correct my mistake in order to produce a working solution.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- Although I'm relatively new to the realm of web development, it's been very interesting to witness the degree of interactivity a developer is able to create between themselves and users. One question I have in particular about web development is the extent to which different types of specialization in careers exist. In addition to that, what skills and interests best align with each of these paths? What distinct role do each of these positions play in the grand scheme of a team's goal that allows for them to be distinguishable? I've been blessed with the opportunity to speak with individuals and mentors from different of web development and know for certain an internship with CodePath would only serve to further expand my overarching knowledge.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had a few more hours to work and refine this project, first and foremost, I would dive deeper into educational material on the languages we used in order to better familiarize myself with them. Although I'm just beginning my journey into web development, I've greatly enjoyed this experience and would love to better equip myself with the tools and knowledge to better improve this project and future endeavors. For instance, I was unable to correctly implement the ticking clock function, but upon further reflection, I believe that with more time to delve into different methods of timekeeping, I could create an efficient and sound solution. Additionally, I also intended on implementing sound effects to match the animal icons on my buttons, but felt that I would need to spend a bit more time reviewing audio embedding.
